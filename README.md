## ⚰️ About the Keeper
I am the curator of midnight patches, the author of creeping frameworks, the one who whispers to sleeping machines. I collect corrupted logs, stitch broken binaries with whispers, and leave little signatures of crimson across the commit history.

My repositories are mausoleums: quiet, full of dust, and occasionally blinking.

## 📜 Creed of the Keeper
I code with patience. I wait for processes to sigh. I do not break what I cannot rebuild — I only rearrange the shadows until they fit the pattern I drew in the margins.

If you fork this repository, do it quietly. Leave an offering in `CONTRIBUTE.md`.

---

## 🕯️ Final Note
**If you hear music in the CI logs, do not follow it.**  
But if you must—bring coffee, a stout editor, and a willingness to read the margins.
